### REPL

Similar with what python does in command line.
More in [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_repl_terminal.htm).

### Debugging

Set breakpoints by addng the `debugger;` keyword just before the line you want to check.

See [server.js](server.js)

Instead of running `node server.js`, run `node debug server.js`

The program will break at the 3rd line. Enter `cont` to continue running the program.

Once you reach your desired breakpoint, enter `repl` to enter the REPL mode. And you can try any variable you want.

Press ctrl-C to exit REPL mode, press 2 more times to quit the program.
